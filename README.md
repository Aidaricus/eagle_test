## ðŸ¦… eagle

Repository allows one to train eagle draft model fully compatible with [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) that achives [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15077v1) score in terms of end to end latency speed up and generation throughput. I will work on this project to make it minimalistic as possible while making it scalable to allow you to train SOTA eagle draft model under 1 hour on a single node of enterprise GPUs but not limited to.
