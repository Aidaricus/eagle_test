## ðŸ¦… eagle

This repository allows you to train your eagle draft model with ease and prepare required artifacts fully compatible with [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) to serve your trained eagle draft model. In documentation I provide step by step guide how to reproduce eagle 1 paper results on sharegpt dataset with metrics almost the same as reported in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15077v1)
