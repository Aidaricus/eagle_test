## ðŸ¦… eagle

This repository allows you to train your eagle draft model with ease and prepare required artifacts fully compatible with vLLM to use out of the box. Below I show step by step how to **train your eagle draft model and deploy to vLLM in 3 minutes with around 60% acceptance rate** using simple pre defined dataset for visualization purposes. Then you can swap dataset and increase complexity of your draft model throw using more layers or something. I created this repository because every implementation of eagle was truly hard to run from documentation page and what is more important deploy to vLLM
